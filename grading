🎓 Python Grade Calculator 🎓
A handy Python script designed to automatically assign a letter grade based on a student's marks. It's a simple and effective tool for quick grade evaluation! 📝

🎯 Purpose of the Script
This project provides a Python function that takes a student's numerical score as input and instantly outputs the corresponding letter grade. The goal is to automate the simple task of grading, making it faster and less prone to manual error. ✨

📈 The Grading Scale
The script determines the final grade by checking which range the input marks fall into. Here is a breakdown of the grading logic:

Marks Range

Grade

82 - 90

A+

72 - 79

A

62 - 69

B+

52 - 59

B

Note: 🤔 This script is designed for the specific ranges above. It currently does not assign a grade for scores of 91 or higher, 51 or lower, or exact boundary numbers like 81, 70, etc.

🚀 How to Use It
Using the script is incredibly simple. Just run the file, and it will execute a pre-written example. To test different scores, you can modify the number passed into the grade() function call within the script.

Example 1: Getting a "B+"
If you provide the function with a score of 65, it will fall into the "B+" category.

Expected Output:

grade=B+

Example 2: Getting an "A"
If you provide the function with a score of 75, it will fall into the "A" category.
